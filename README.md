# Useless Clocks

*A collection of useless clocks. Weird.*

[Try it out!]()

## Wait what?

I always try hard to describe the idea and the reasoning behind each and every of my project, embellishing the *(often boring)* process of coding with a bit of *(always real and never invented)* storytelling.

The idea for this absolutely dumb and utterly useless project came to me while I was sleeping.
All my half-asleep brain could see in my spinning room was a bunch of changing clocks, each one with a different time format, equally useless and equally fascinating.
As soon as I woke up, I completely forgot about it and went on with my day to day life.

A few weeks pass by, and in a moment of pure and complete procrastination, I decided to start this project.
Some designs *(such as the ones including sine waves)* have been inspired by an exhibition from about 15 years ago at Hangar Bicocca in Milan, Italy.

## What's inside?

This project contains multiple useless clocks, each one representing the current time in a different, and completely unreadable, way.
You can navigate the different clocks either clicking (or tapping) to the left and right of the screen, or using `q` and `e` keys.

To see a description of each clock (reported here as well), click (or tap) the button below the clock itself.
